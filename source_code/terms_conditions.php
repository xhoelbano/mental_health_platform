                    Terms & Conditions<br>
                    The users’ confidentiality and anonymity will be keep in compliance with psychological ethical laws.
                    The term "confidentiality" refers to the separation or modification of any personally identifiable
                    information submitted by participants from the data. On the other hand, anonymity refers to
                    collecting data without getting any personally identifiable information. In most quantitative
                    research, anonymity is preserved, whereas in qualitative studies, confidentiality is maintained.
                    The system proposed collects information from participants in both circumstances, and this
                    information becomes the data to be evaluated. People's actions and experiences, rather than an
                    exposé about individuals, are of tremendous interest to social scientists. Researchers in the case
                    of the system, psychologists) are required to respect their subjects, but they are less interested
                    in reporting on the behavior of a specific individual.
                    In the “education” environment, since there will be engaged students aged (12 – 18 years old) and
                    they do not are legaly accepted to open an email in order to register to our system, I found a way
                    in order so they could be registered and in the same time have access on the studies/surveys offered
                    in their educational institution by its psychologist. The educational psychologist will be
                    responsible to enter e list (register) of students name, part of the educational institute he is
                    associated in. He will also put the emails of the parents or legal representative.
