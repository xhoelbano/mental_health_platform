                    The creation, design, and use of web applications that are focused on mental health care
                    (E-mental health) present several advantages when compared with traditional mental health
                    methods being applied nowadays. This platform focuses on raising peopleâ€™s awareness and increasing
                    their attention
                    towards mental health care. <br><br>
                    The platform is intended to serve as a tool to educate people by making them realize that mental
                    health care is
                    a necessity and not a luxury, by involving them in the studies/surveys directly, and by presenting
                    them with
                    live infographics based on people's responses and interaction. At any time the system/platform will
                    keep the
                    users' anonymity and confidentiality and create a secure environment for them to interact. The web
                    application
                    proposed, would have on top of it verified psychologists who will have the privilege to create
                    studies/surveys
                    and spread them among the user, get results, and give conclusions.
