# Analysis, Design and Implementation of a Digital Mental Health Platform - [Bachelor thesis](https://github.com/xhoelbano/mental_health_platform/blob/main/Bachelor_Thesis_Xhoel_Bano.pdf)
The creation, design, and use of web applications that are focused on mental health care (E-mental health) present several advantages when compared with traditional mental health methods being applied nowadays. 
In this research/thesis, I have proposed a web-based mental health platform, which focuses on raising peopleâ€™s awareness and increasing their attention toward mental health care. 
The platform is intended to serve as a tool to educate people by making them realize that mental health care is a necessity and not a luxury, by involving them in the studies/surveys directly, and by presenting them with live infographics based on people's responses and interaction. 
At any time the system/platform will keep the users' anonymity and confidentiality and create a secure environment for them to interact.

A new mental health platform approach is proposed bringing a novel contribution to the currently developed market. The conducted research demonstrates through design schemas and software implementation the highly impactful role of the psychologist as a main leading influential in the proposed mental health platform.

At the [Wiki section](https://github.com/xhoelbano/mental_health_platform/wiki) in this project, organized on different pages you can find detailed documentation of the analysis, design, and implementation of the Mental Health Platform proposed in my research.
